# Benchmarks and ablations

## What is measured today

The harness runs 20 questions over a deterministic fixture (200 orders, 60
customers, DuckDB, no randomness). It compares result sets, not SQL strings.

```bash
pnpm bench          # execution accuracy with controls
pnpm bench:linking  # schema-linking recall@3 ablation
pnpm bench:ablate   # paired question-normalization ablation
pnpm bench:bird     # external benchmark, see below
```

All artifacts land in `eval/out/` and are uploaded by the CI `benchmark` job.

## Controls come first

| Predictor | Exact | Unordered | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `oracle` (gold SQL) | 100.0% | 100.0% | positive control |
| `empty` (`select 1 where false`) | 0.0% | 0.0% | negative control |
| `template-raw` | 80.0% | 80.0% | non-LLM baseline, literal keywords |
| `template` (normalized) | 80.0% | 80.0% | baseline with synonym mapping |

The run fails if either control breaks. A benchmark that cannot separate a
perfect answer from an empty one is not measuring anything.

The 80% baseline is a **template matcher**, not a language model. It handles
`total revenue by region`, `how many orders by region`, `top 3 products by
revenue`, `monthly revenue` and similar patterns. It fails on windows (`q18`,
`q20`), median (`q19`), filters (`q15`) and two-dimension groupings (`q14`).

## Schema-linking ablation (recall@3, 25 questions)

| Arm | Recall@3 | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name only | 20.0% (5/25) | — |
| + alias | 56.0% (14/25) | +36.0pp |
| + sample values | 84.0% (21/25) | +28.0pp |

This is the clearest measured result in the repository: value profiling is worth
28pp on its own, and aliases 36pp. Both are cheap (no model call). The four
remaining misses are genuine: they require knowing that "orders" maps to
`order_id` even when the question never says "id", and that two same-named
columns in different tables both matter.

## Question-normalization ablation (paired, n=20)

| Arm | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| raw keywords | 80.0% |
| synonym mapping | 80.0% |

Delta +0.0pp, 0 discordant pairs, McNemar exact p = 1.0.

**Conclusion: no evidence that normalization helps on this set.** The code is
kept because it is harmless and the sample is small, but the documentation does
not claim a benefit. With 0 discordant pairs the test has no power; the next
iteration expands the set to ≥100 questions before drawing a conclusion.

## Semantic compiler ablation

`pnpm bench:semantic` runs 200 generated metric queries (8 metric sets × 6
dimension sets × 3 filter sets) against the deterministic fixture, compiling each
one twice: with the optimizer and without it.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Identical result sets (optimized vs plain) | **200 / 200** |
| CTEs per query | 7.40 → 4.88 (**34.1% fewer**) |
| Naive join vs grain-first, per segment | **3.00x** inflation |

The optimizer is allowed to change SQL, never rows. If one pair diverges the run
fails. The fan-out number is produced by executing a hand-written join and the
compiled query against the same data; the fixture uses `DECIMAL` money columns so
the comparison is exact, not floating-point tolerant.

## Live NL to SQL evaluation

`pnpm bench:live` runs 210 generated questions over the semantic fixture through
a real model (`deepseek-chat`), three times per case, majority-scored. Every gold
query is executed before the model is called.

Latest run (GitHub Actions, commit `f9c8e6e`):

| Arm | Execution accuracy | 95% Wilson | Cases that disagreed with themselves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| schema names | **100%** (210/210) | [98.2, 100] | 0 |
| + enum samples | **100%** (210/210) | [98.2, 100] | 0 |
| + repair loop (2 turns) | **100%** (210/210) | [98.2, 100] | 0 |

**This is a ceiling, not a capability claim.** Twenty intents with paraphrases
are saturated by the current model, so the paired ablations show no difference
and cannot measure a module's contribution. Two earlier runs did:
enum samples induced an unstated `status = 'completed'` filter on 31 cases
(97.1% → 82.4%, McNemar p < 1e-9), and missing column comments made the model
treat item price × quantity as the order amount. Both prompt defects are fixed;
the regression and its fix are recorded rather than hidden by the final number.

Headroom now comes from the external benchmark below. No SOTA claim is made
there either: 58.6% on 239 of 500 questions, one model, one sample per case, no
fine-tuning, is a baseline to beat, not a record.

## External benchmark: BIRD Mini-Dev

The synthetic set saturates: every arm scores 100%, so it cannot rank modules.
BIRD Mini-Dev does not: its schemas, questions, gold SQL and SQLite databases
were written by someone else.

```bash
node eval/bird/fetch.mjs        # ~800 MB archive, extracts the databases that are missing
pnpm bench:bird:dry             # gold execution, schema fidelity, prompt coverage; no model
pnpm bench:bird:port            # DuckDB portability census
pnpm bench:bird                 # five arms, paired ablations, live model
pnpm bench:bird:stability       # 60 cases x 3 repeats: the noise floor
```

Scope: **all 11 databases, 239 of 500 questions** (stratified by difficulty, one
gold statement excluded because it exceeds the 30 s budget), `deepseek-chat`,
temperature 0, one sample per case. Artifacts: `eval/out/bird-eval.json`,
`eval/out/bird-stability.json`, `eval/out/duckdb-portability.json`.

### Controls (these fail the run, not just the table)

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Gold statements executed before any model call | **239 / 240** (99.6%) |
| Gold executed twice and compared to itself | **239 / 239** identical |
| Negative control: empty result vs non-empty gold | **0** false matches |
| Schema fidelity: advertised columns exist in the database | **798 / 798** |
| Prompt coverage: tables that reach the schema card | **75 / 75** (no truncation) |

### Accuracy (run J, same 239 cases in every arm)

| Arm | Execution accuracy | 95% Wilson | prompt chars (mean) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| names only | 32.6% (78/239) | [27.0, 38.8] | 1,818 |
| model-written definitions, as a block | 33.1% (79/239) | [27.5, 39.4] | 2,820 |
| the same text on the column line | 42.7% (102/239) | [36.6, 49.0] | 2,499 |
| + the dataset's per-question hint | **56.9%** (136/239) | [50.5, 63.1] | 2,633 |
| + **three executed samples, modal result** | 55.6% (133/239) | [49.2, 61.8] | 2,633 (3 calls) |
| metadata + the dataset's per-question hint | **58.2%** (139/239) | [51.8, 64.3] | 7,605 |

| Change | Δ | only before / only after | p | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| block → column line (same text) | **+9.6pp** | 8 / 31 | 2.9e-4 | real |
| inline definitions → + the dataset's question hint | **+14.2pp** | 7 / 42 | 3.6e-07 | real |
| single sample → **three samples, modal result** | −1.3pp | 6 / 3 | 0.51 | **no measurable effect** |

### Voting cannot recover knowledge the model never had

Three samples per question at temperature 0.7, executed, and the modal result set
kept: **55.6% against 56.9%** for a single sample. The samples agreed with each
other **90% of the time**.

That agreement is the explanation. Voting helps when errors are random — it picks
the majority of draws around the right answer. Here the errors are systematic:
when the model does not know what "paid in EUR" means, all three samples make the
same wrong choice, and the majority is wrong three times instead of once. The
remaining gap is knowledge, and no amount of resampling creates it.

### The generated stack matches the curated one at a third of the prompt

`inline+evidence` reaches **56.1%** with a 2,624-character prompt.
`metadata+evidence` — 798 curated column notes plus the same hint — reaches
**56.9%** with 7,605 characters. The difference is two cases.

That is the product claim this whole line of work was looking for: a database
without documentation can be brought to the accuracy of a database with it, by
generating definitions once per database and attaching them to the columns. What
it cannot do is replace the per-question hint: that is still worth +13.8pp.

### A model-written reading of the question buys nothing

Asking the model to restate what the question computes — measure, rows counted,
numerator and denominator — before writing SQL changed **exactly zero** cases:
17 fixed, 17 broken, p=1.0, and one extra call per question.

The reading is not wrong; it is redundant. The information it restates was already
in the prompt. What BIRD's hint supplies is knowledge the prompt does not contain —
which currency counts as "paying in EUR" — and restating a question cannot invent
it. This closes the "ask the model to think first" branch: the gap is knowledge,
not reasoning order.

### Who wrote the text does not matter; where it sits does

Run H adds the control the placement result needed: the dataset's own column
descriptions, truncated to exactly the columns the generated block reached (128
versus 143). Same placement, same columns covered, different author.

They are indistinguishable: **43.1% vs 41.8%**, one case each way, p=0.375. Curated
documentation buys nothing over generated documentation once both are attached to
the column, on the same columns.

Raising addressability from 36.8% (57 lines) to 92.3% (143 lines) also changed
nothing: the arm moved 42.3% → 41.8% while its prompt grew from 2,166 to 2,496
characters. Most of the effect comes from the first few dozen columns a question
might touch; the tail of rarely mentioned columns adds text, not accuracy.

### Placement, not content: three runs of the same sentences

| Run | block | inline | Δ | prompt (block → inline) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 (`9120c2b`) | 33.1% | **43.5%** | **+10.5pp** (9/34, p=1.7e-4) | 2,819 → 2,166 |
| G2 (`148a621`) | 33.9% | **42.3%** | **+8.4pp** (12/32, p=0.0037) | 2,819 → 2,166 |
| H (`d5927b0`) | 35.1% | 41.8% | **+6.7pp** (11/27, p=0.014) | 2,819 → 2,496 |
| I (`700529b`) | 33.5% | **42.3%** | **+8.8pp** (10/31, p=0.0015) | 2,817 → 2,490 |

Same cached sentences, same model, same cases. The only change is where they sit:
attached to the column they describe instead of appended after the schema card.
Both runs clear the 6pp bar that the previous two attempts missed.

Two controls make this credible:

- **No dataset metadata leaked in.** The inline arm runs on a bare schema built
  with `withNotes: false`, so the only comments are the ones attached. The
  artifact records `inlineSchemaComments = 57` against 798 dataset columns. The
  first attempt at this arm did not do that, scored +9.2pp, and was thrown away:
  its prompt had grown from 2,819 to 7,395 characters, which was the tell that it
  had quietly re-enabled the metadata lever.
- **Only addressable lines survive.** 57 of 155 generated lines name a column and
  were attached; 98 were table-level or unplaceable and were dropped. The arm
  that scores +8.4pp is *shorter* than the block it replaces, so the gain cannot
  be a length effect.

On the adversarial face the inline arm scores **84.4% (27/32), equal to `names`**
and 12.5pp above full column metadata (71.9%). A per-column definition does not
cost what a full description card costs on window and ratio questions.

### What is still missing

The best arm remains `metadata+evidence` at 58.6%, and the dataset's own evidence
is still worth **+17.6pp** on top of any definition text. That is now the single
largest unexplained term in the pipeline, and it is question-level by
construction: BIRD writes one sentence per *question*, and nothing that is written
once per *database* has moved the number.

Two things are settled: the text can be generated instead of curated, and it has
to sit on the column. What is left is the per-question sentence.

### Noise floor (why one sample per case is stated, not assumed)

60 stratified cases, three repeats each, arm `metadata+evidence`:

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Cases that disagreed with themselves | **2 / 60 (3.3%)** |
| Majority accuracy | 45.0% |
| Single-run accuracy | 45.0% |
| Difference | **0.0pp** |

Single sampling does not bias the aggregate, but it does move individual cases.
The flip rate across runs is 8.3%, 3.3%, 1.7%, 6.7% — it moves, while the
single-run and majority scores never do. A single run's aggregate is stable; a
single case's answer is not. Deltas below 4pp are reported as "no measurable
effect" (ADR-166), and the +8.4pp above is reported with its pair counts so it can
be checked.

### Adversarial shapes (32 hand-written cases, reported separately)

An aggregate hides the shapes it is bad at. These 32 cases cover windows, ratios,
multi-hop joins and ties, each with a declared output width that the gold must
match — a question promising two columns and a gold returning three would fail
every correct answer.

| Shape | names | structural | **inline** | metadata | adaptive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| window | 6/8 | 5/8 | 4/8 | 3/8 | 5/8 |
| ratio | 6/8 | 6/8 | 6/8 | 5/8 | 5/8 |
| multi-hop | **8/8** | 7/8 | **8/8** | **8/8** | **8/8** |
| tie | 7/8 | 7/8 | 7/8 | 7/8 | 7/8 |
| **total** | **81.2%** (26/32) | 78.1% (25/32) | 75.0% (24/32) | 71.9% (23/32) | 75.0% (24/32) |

On these shapes the inline arm never gains: across four paired runs it equals
`names` twice (84.4% / 81.2%) and trails by one and two cases twice (78.1% /
75.0% vs 81.2%). At n=32 a case is 3.1pp, so none of these is significant, but the
direction is consistently non-positive — a column's definition helps a filter and
adds nothing to a window. What is clear is the comparison with full metadata:
71.9% in every run, 6 to 9 points below the bare schema.

The two faces disagree in a way worth remembering: metadata is worth +11.3pp on
BIRD and −9pp here. A component's effect is a property of a question shape, not
of the component.

### DuckDB portability of the same gold statements

| Stage | Runnable | Taxonomy of the rest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| as written | 199/250 (79.6%) | Parser 27 (backtick quoting), Binder 14, Catalog 10 (`iif`) |
| backticks rewritten to quotes | 217/250 (86.8%) | Binder 21, Catalog 10, Parser 2 |
| + `iif` macro | **227/250 (90.8%)** | Binder 21, Parser 2 |

The census covers the six smallest databases; the remaining 23 failures are
dialect strictness, not bugs: arithmetic on text dates, bare columns in
`GROUP BY` (SQLite picks a row, DuckDB refuses), and `BETWEEN` over mixed types.

### Judges: official and strict

BIRD's judge is `set(predicted) == set(gold)` over tuples
(`evaluation/evaluation_ex.py`), which ignores row order and **collapses
duplicate rows**. The strict column compares multisets; the official rule credits
4–9 extra cases per arm on this slice. Both numbers are published so the choice
is visible instead of implied.

## What these numbers are not

- **Not a SOTA claim.** The dataset is a local fixture, not BIRD, Spider 2.0 or
  Text2Vis. It cannot be compared to published leaderboard numbers.
- **Not an LLM result.** The pipeline is exercised with a template baseline and
  a replay provider in CI. Live-model numbers require the benchmark workflow
  with a real key and a larger set.
- **Not execution-accuracy-complete.** Row order is compared both ways because
  gold queries often carry an `ORDER BY` that a correct answer may omit; the gap
  between exact and unordered is reported rather than hidden.

## Policy for future SOTA runs

1. Every accuracy gate declares a `baseline` and a `baselineSource`. Without
   them the number is `UNBASELINED` and does not count.
2. A target that is within the minimum detectable difference of its baseline is
   `VACUOUS`.
3. Comparisons are paired on identical questions. Report discordant pairs and a
   McNemar exact p-value; do not report a bare delta.
4. Ablations change one thing. Multi-change runs are labelled exploratory.
5. Absolute targets are frozen until a ≥200-question set exists; before that,
   relative improvement is the only honest signal.

## The floor is enforced, not remembered

A benchmark that only produces a report gets read once. The BIRD arms have a
committed floor (`eval/baseline/bird.json`) taken from the minimum of the last four
runs, and the workflow fails when an arm lands more than 4pp below it — the same
4pp that ADR-166 measured as the noise threshold at n=239:

```bash
pnpm gate:bird
# BIRD floor: <n> questions, <arm> <accuracy>, …
```

Three details make the gate mean something:

- **the arm set is part of the check**: an arm in the baseline that vanishes from
  the report fails, because "we stopped measuring it" is not an improvement;
- **the sample size is checked first**: a report scored on fewer than 95% of the
  baseline questions is a different measurement, and comparing across it would
  attribute a dataset change to the pipeline;
- **the gate has a self-test** (`node tools/check-bird-baseline.mjs --self-test`)
  that plants a passing run, a noisy run, a 10pp regression, a missing arm and a
  shrunken sample. A gate nobody has seen fail is a gate nobody should trust.

## Reproducing

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm bench
cat eval/out/results.json
cat eval/out/linking-ablation.json
cat eval/out/ablation.json
```

The fixture is `eval/fixtures.sql`; the questions are `eval/golden.jsonl`. Both
are reviewed like code: a new case needs a gold query that is unambiguous and
deterministic.
