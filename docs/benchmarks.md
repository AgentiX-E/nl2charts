# Benchmarks and ablations

## What is measured today

The harness runs 20 questions over a deterministic fixture (200 orders, 60
customers, DuckDB, no randomness). It compares result sets, not SQL strings.

```bash
pnpm bench          # execution accuracy with controls
pnpm bench:linking  # schema-linking recall@3 ablation
pnpm bench:ablate   # paired question-normalization ablation
```

All artifacts land in `eval/out/` and are uploaded by the CI `benchmark` job.

## Controls come first

| Predictor | Exact | Unordered | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `oracle` (gold SQL) | 100.0% | 100.0% | positive control |
| `empty` (`select 1 where false`) | 0.0% | 0.0% | negative control |
| `template-raw` | 80.0% | 80.0% | non-LLM baseline, literal keywords |
| `template` (normalized) | 80.0% | 80.0% | baseline with synonym mapping |

The run fails if either control breaks. A benchmark that cannot separate a
perfect answer from an empty one is not measuring anything.

The 80% baseline is a **template matcher**, not a language model. It handles
`total revenue by region`, `how many orders by region`, `top 3 products by
revenue`, `monthly revenue` and similar patterns. It fails on windows (`q18`,
`q20`), median (`q19`), filters (`q15`) and two-dimension groupings (`q14`).

## Schema-linking ablation (recall@3, 25 questions)

| Arm | Recall@3 | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name only | 20.0% (5/25) | — |
| + alias | 56.0% (14/25) | +36.0pp |
| + sample values | 84.0% (21/25) | +28.0pp |

This is the clearest measured result in the repository: value profiling is worth
28pp on its own, and aliases 36pp. Both are cheap (no model call). The four
remaining misses are genuine: they require knowing that "orders" maps to
`order_id` even when the question never says "id", and that two same-named
columns in different tables both matter.

## Question-normalization ablation (paired, n=20)

| Arm | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| raw keywords | 80.0% |
| synonym mapping | 80.0% |

Delta +0.0pp, 0 discordant pairs, McNemar exact p = 1.0.

**Conclusion: no evidence that normalization helps on this set.** The code is
kept because it is harmless and the sample is small, but the documentation does
not claim a benefit. With 0 discordant pairs the test has no power; the next
iteration expands the set to ≥100 questions before drawing a conclusion.

## Semantic compiler ablation

`pnpm bench:semantic` runs 200 generated metric queries (8 metric sets × 6
dimension sets × 3 filter sets) against the deterministic fixture, compiling each
one twice: with the optimizer and without it.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Identical result sets (optimized vs plain) | **200 / 200** |
| CTEs per query | 7.40 → 4.88 (**34.1% fewer**) |
| Naive join vs grain-first, per segment | **3.00x** inflation |

The optimizer is allowed to change SQL, never rows. If one pair diverges the run
fails. The fan-out number is produced by executing a hand-written join and the
compiled query against the same data; the fixture uses `DECIMAL` money columns so
the comparison is exact, not floating-point tolerant.

## What these numbers are not

- **Not a SOTA claim.** The dataset is a local fixture, not BIRD, Spider 2.0 or
  Text2Vis. It cannot be compared to published leaderboard numbers.
- **Not an LLM result.** The pipeline is exercised with a template baseline and
  a replay provider in CI. Live-model numbers require the benchmark workflow
  with a real key and a larger set.
- **Not execution-accuracy-complete.** Row order is compared both ways because
  gold queries often carry an `ORDER BY` that a correct answer may omit; the gap
  between exact and unordered is reported rather than hidden.

## Policy for future SOTA runs

1. Every accuracy gate declares a `baseline` and a `baselineSource`. Without
   them the number is `UNBASELINED` and does not count.
2. A target that is within the minimum detectable difference of its baseline is
   `VACUOUS`.
3. Comparisons are paired on identical questions. Report discordant pairs and a
   McNemar exact p-value; do not report a bare delta.
4. Ablations change one thing. Multi-change runs are labelled exploratory.
5. Absolute targets are frozen until a ≥200-question set exists; before that,
   relative improvement is the only honest signal.

## Reproducing

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm bench
cat eval/out/results.json
cat eval/out/linking-ablation.json
cat eval/out/ablation.json
```

The fixture is `eval/fixtures.sql`; the questions are `eval/golden.jsonl`. Both
are reviewed like code: a new case needs a gold query that is unambiguous and
deterministic.
